# Playwrite

*Playwrite* is a typeface engine that allows the creation of primary school cursive fonts. These school fonts are the practical result of the Primarium research project [www.primarium.info] a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of instruction methodologies and models taught to primary school students worldwide. Its findings with regards to the calligraphic models currently in use, their development and rationale, informed the design of the *Playwrite* glyphs.

The shape of the handwritten Latin alphabethas developed following different currents, trends and colonial influences around the world. As a result, the very notion of what constitutes primary school cursive writing varies dramatically. It could be vertical or slanted, fully joined or semi-joined, uppercase letters can be ornate and decorative or simply borrowed from print styles, lowercase letters can be based on round or oval foundational shapes, and the proportion of the x-height vis-a-vis the ascenders and descenders can differ.

## Build instructions

The definitiv, estable, fonts are built by the Continuous Integrated engine, which runs every time the source files are updated in the repository. It produces a .zip file with all the built fonts that which is included on each `Action` run as well as pushes the produced fonts into the `fonts` directory.

If you want to build fonts manually on your own computer as part of the development or testing process:

* `make build` will produce font files. But they shound not be pushed manually to the repository. Once you are happy with the changes in the source files, please only push them and the CI run will produce the definitive fonts.


## Letter variations

Based on the Primarium study the TypeTogether team isolated a limited number of structural variations for the Latin letter shapes: 8 variation styles for lower cases and three for uppercases. With the help of a sturdy contextual alternate (CALT) opentype code these different veriation groups can be seamlessly combined.


### Precursive
Default set of lower case letters. These are completely unjoined.  
<br>

![Alt Image Text](documentation/images/readme/Playwrite_variatiokey1.png)

### Modern cursive  
Same design as precursive in isolated shape but it istriggers a semi-connected typesetting.
Uses .mod suffix (e.g. n.mod). 
<br>

![Alt Image Text](documentation/images/readme/Playwrite_variatiokey2.png)

### Fully joined odern cursive  
Adds loops to descenders and connecting strokes to letters that do not connect in .mod.
Uses .jmc suffix (e.g. g.jmc). 
<br>

![Alt Image Text](documentation/images/readme/Playwrite_variatiokey3.png)

### Full Cursive  
Construction os several glyphs change to match a continuous cursive style.
Uses .ful suffix (e.g. s.ful). 
<br>

### Speed loops  
Adds speedloops to most letters with ascender strokes.
Uses .lop suffix (e.g. h.lop). 
<br>

### Curved entry stroke  
Changes the lead-in connection at x-heigh level for several letters.
Uses .cnt suffix (e.g. n.cnt). 
<br>

![Alt Image Text](documentation/images/readme/Playwrite_variatiokey6.png)

### Mirrored loops  
Adds loops in to two letters and switches loop direction in “f”.
Uses .mrr suffix (e.g. f.mrr). 
<br>

![Alt Image Text](documentation/images/readme/Playwrite_variatiokey7.png)

### Microloops  
Adds knots or small loops to mark stroke direction change in some letters.
Uses .mlp suffix (e.g. o.mlp). 
<br>

![Alt Image Text](documentation/images/readme/Playwrite_variatiokey8.png)

### Print  
Default set of upper case letters. These are completely unjoined.  
<br>

![Alt Image Text](documentation/images/readme/Playwrite_variatiokey9.png)

### Cursive upper cases  
Cursive capitals. Also enable connection with a number of lowercase letters
Uses .cur suffix (e.g. A.cur). 
<br>

![Alt Image Text](documentation/images/readme/Playwrite_variatiokey10.png)

### Decorative upper cases  
Secondary set of decorative capitals to match certain handwriting models. These are semi-connected.
Uses .dec suffix (e.g. G.dec). 
<br>

![Alt Image Text](documentation/images/readme/Playwrite_variatiokey11.png)

### Regional variants lower cases  
Alternative designs necessary for one or more specific regions. These use suffix locl when used in several fonts or locl_XX where XX is a two letter country code. (e.g. Q.dec_pt).

## Design variation axes

Playwrite's design space spans over four variation axes: the slant of the letters, ascender and descender length, typographic color, and a stroke speed axes that controls the tension of the curves and the direction and connection of the strokes.

- **Weight - `wght`**
`Min: 100
Max: 400`

- **Slant - `slnt`**
`Min: 0
Max: -18`

- **Speed - `SPED`**
`Min: 0
Max: 100`

- **Vertical Extension - `YEXT`**
`Min: 0
Max: 100`

## Country recipes

![Alt Image Text](documentation/images/readme/Playwrite_countries-references.png)

Recipes for regional models of the Playwrite font arecreated by recipes that reside on a CSV file `Playwrite/sources/data/models-all.csv`. Each row of the file contains the data that names the font model, specifies a location in three of the founr axes (the weight axis always remains variable), and contains a selection of the of the letter variants that are preferred in that region.

Structure of each row is as follows:   
`Country;lang_tag;slnt;EXTD;SPED;UC;lc`

The classes UC and lc must contain the exact number of glyphs that is expected in the substitution classes, and in the correct order:   
`@UC = [A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z AE Eth IJ Eng OE Thorn Germandbls];  ` 

`@lc = [a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z ae eth ij eng oe thorn germandbls idotless jdotless];`

Here is an example of the recipe used for the Canada Playwrite Font:   
`Canada;CAN;18;496;100;A.cur_locl B.dec C.cur D.dec E.cur F.dec G.dec H.dec I.cur J.cur K.dec L.dec M.cur N.cur O.dec P.dec Q.cur R.dec S.cur T.dec U.cur V.cur W.cur X.cur Y.cur Z.cur AE.cur Eth IJ.cur Eng OE.cur Thorn Germandbls;a.mod b.lop c.mod d.mod e.ful f.mrr g.jmc h.lop i.mod j.jmc k.lop l.lop m.cnt n.cnt o.mod p.mrr_ca q.mrr r.ful s.ful t.mod u.mod v.cnt w.cnt x.ful y.cnt z.cnt ae.ful eth.mod ij.jmc eng oe.ful thorn.jmc germandbls.jmc idotless.mod jdotless.jmc `

## Create or edit handwriting models
After creating or editing glyphs and modifying the Recipe table you will need to prepare the files for font generation following these four steps.  
1. Write the model dictionary  
2. Write the feature file for models  
3. Update the design space  
4. Create UFOs from the Glyphpackage file

Now you are ready to build new fonts following the build instructions:
