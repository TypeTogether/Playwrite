The style of handwriting currently taught in New Zealand is specified in Teaching Handwriting, a Ministry of Education publication, which was originally developed in response to teachers’ requests for guidance on the style of handwriting that should be taught in primary school. Teachers and schools usually create their own resources for handwriting instruction based on the style advocated in this document. It was first released in 1985 and its latest iteration was released in 2025. Teaching Handwriting outlines a progressive handwriting education system that advances from simplified print script to semi-joined cursive writing. 
Playwrite New Zealand was updated in 2025 in partnership with the Ministry of Education of New Zealand. It is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages. It has a single-weight sibling with Guides, Playwrite NZ Guides, designed to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a visual aid for primary school children. The alphabet for earlier education stages is called Playwrite NZ Basic.

Playwrite New Zealand Characteristics
This modern cursive style is extremely fast and slanted, featuring simplified print-style uppercase letters. Notable are the open 'G' without a crossbar, a serifed 'I', and a 'Y' with a slanted stem. The lowercase letters are semi-connected, exhibiting a very fast and angular construction typical of modern cursive styles based on italic forms. The letter 'f' does not have a descender, and 'q' is distinguished by a short exit stroke that serves as a finial, enhancing the dynamic and streamlined appearance of the script.
