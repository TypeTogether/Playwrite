The Dutch-French language divide in Belgium, a phenomenon with roots stretching back to the Middle Ages, continues to be relevant in the country today. Traditions of handwriting education exemplify this circumstance, and reflect the country's historical ties to France and the Netherlands. Regardless of the handwriting model adopted, students learn print script letters in kindergarten and progress to connected letters in primary school. In Flanders, there is a preference for sloped continuous cursive writing, reminiscent of Dutch handwriting models, whereas the French-speaking community in the Walloon region opts for upright cursive writing, a style that enjoys popularity in France. This diversity in handwriting education is a direct response to Belgium's rich linguistic culture, leading to the introduction of a second official language early in the school years.

This style is a slanted, fully connected continuous cursive. It features decorative capital letters, some of which, like 'A', closely resemble a cursive structure. The extenders are of medium length, enhancing the fluidity. 'T' and 'Z' are designed with a crossbar, while 'X' includes loops that facilitates continuous writing without lifting the pen. The 'S' maintains a straight spine. The lowercase 'f' features only a top loop, connecting from its crossbar, and the 't' has a crossbar that extends only to the right, giving it a distinctive appearance.
