Playwrite NZ Basic
The style of handwriting currently taught in New Zealand is specified in Teaching Handwriting, a Ministry of Education publication, which was originally developed in response to teachers’ requests for guidance on the style of handwriting that should be taught in primary school. Teachers and schools usually create their own resources for handwriting instruction based on the style advocated in this document. It was first released in 1985 and its latest iteration was released in 2025. Teaching Handwriting outlines a progressive handwriting education system that advances from this simplified print script to semi-joined cursive writing. 
Playwrite New Zealand Basic was created in 2025 upon requirements and specifications from the Ministry of Education of New Zealand. It is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages. It has a single-weight sibling with Guides, Playwrite NZ Basic Guides, designed to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a visual aid for primary school children. The alphabet for later education stages is called Playwrite NZ.


Playwrite New Zealand Basic characteristics
This simplified print style is moderately slanted, featuring unadorned uppercase letters and unjoined lowercases. Notable are the open 'G' without a crossbar, a serifed 'I', and a 'Y' with a slanted stem. The lowercase letters are simple, exhibiting a very fast and angular construction typical of modern cursive styles based on italic forms. The letter 'f' does not have a descender, ’t’ does not have an exit stroke, and finials on ascending and descending strokes are open and casual, enhancing the dynamic and streamlined appearance of the script.
