>
>Visually QAing thousands of glyphs by hand is tiring. Most glyphs can only be constructured in a handful of ways. This means a glyph's contour count will only differ slightly amongst different fonts, e.g a 'g' could either be 2 or 3 contours, depending on whether its double story or single story.
>
>However, a quotedbl should have 2 contours, unless the font belongs to a display family.
>
>This check currently does not cover variable fonts because there's plenty of alternative ways of constructing glyphs with multiple outlines for each feature in a VarFont. The expected contour count data for this check is currently optimized for the typical construction of glyphs in static fonts.
>
* ⚠ **WARN** This check inspects the glyph outlines and detects the total number of contours in each of them. The expected values are infered from the typical ammounts of contours observed in a large collection of reference font families. The divergences listed below may simply indicate a significantly different design on some of your glyphs. On the other hand, some of these may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an incorrect codepoint. Please consider reviewing the design and codepoint assignment of these to make sure they are correct.

>
>The slng structure is intended to describe which languages and scripts the font overall supports. For example, a Traditional Chinese font that also contains Latin characters, can indicate Hant,Latn, showing that it supports Hant, the Traditional Chinese variant of the Hani script, and it also supports the Latn script.
>
>The dlng structure is far more interesting. A font may contain various glyphs, but only a particular subset of the glyphs may be truly "leading" in the design, while other glyphs may have been included for technical reasons. Such a Traditional Chinese font could only list Hant there, showing that it’s designed for Traditional Chinese, but the font would omit Latn, because the developers don’t think the font is really recommended for purely Latin-script use.
>
>The tags used in the structures can comprise just script, or also language and script. For example, if a font has Bulgarian Cyrillic alternates in the locl feature for the cyrl BGR OT languagesystem, it could also indicate in dlng explicitly that it supports bul-Cyrl. (Note that the scripts and languages in meta use the ISO language and script codes, not the OpenType ones).

* 🔥 **FAIL** This is a hinted font, so it must have bit 3 set on the flags of the head table, so that PPEM values will be rounded into an integer value.

This can be accomplished by using the 'gftools fix-hinting' command:

```
# create virtualenv
python3 -m venv venv
# activate virtualenv
source venv/bin/activate
# install gftools
pip install git+https://www.github.com/googlefonts/tools

>
>The OpenType 'meta' table originated at Apple. Microsoft added it to OT with just two DataMap records:
>
>- dlng: comma-separated ScriptLangTags that indicate which scripts, or languages and scripts, with possible variants, the font is designed for.
>
>- slng: comma-separated ScriptLangTags that indicate which scripts, or languages and scripts, with possible variants, the font supports.
>
>The slng structure is intended to describe which languages and scripts the font overall supports. For example, a Traditional Chinese font that also contains Latin characters, can indicate Hant,Latn, showing that it supports Hant, the Traditional Chinese variant of the Hani script, and it also supports the Latn script.
>
>The dlng structure is far more interesting. A font may contain various glyphs, but only a particular subset of the glyphs may be truly "leading" in the design, while other glyphs may have been included for technical reasons. Such a Traditional Chinese font could only list Hant there, showing that it’s designed for Traditional Chinese, but the font would omit Latn, because the developers don’t think the font is really recommended for purely Latin-script use.
>
>The tags used in the structures can comprise just script, or also language and script. For example, if a font has Bulgarian Cyrillic alternates in the locl feature for the cyrl BGR OT languagesystem, it could also indicate in dlng explicitly that it supports bul-Cyrl. (Note that the scripts and languages in meta use the ISO language and script codes, not the OpenType ones).
>
>This check ensures that the font has the meta table containing the slng and dlng structures.
>
>All families in the Google Fonts collection should contain the 'meta' table. Windows 10 already uses it when deciding on which fonts to fall back to. The Google Fonts API and also other environments could use the data for smarter filtering. Most importantly, those entries should be added to the Noto fonts.
>
>In the font making process, some environments store this data in external files already. But the meta table provides a convenient way to store this inside the font file, so some tools may add the data, and unrelated tools may read this data. This makes the solution much more portable and universal.
